# Web UI
Web and mobile web UI

## Core technologies
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) (which is based on React) as the UI framework of choice
- [MUI ](https://mui.com/) as the base component library


## Directory structure explained
Check out the [NextJS docuemtantion](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure) for that information.

The one file that might seem out of place is `project.json`, which is the [Nx project config file](https://nx.dev/reference/project-configuration)

## How to test/run locally
- Run `npm run dev:ui` to start the UI in development mode
- You can now open your browser to http://localhost:4200 to see the UI

## How to deploy
